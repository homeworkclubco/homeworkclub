          When Downtown Productions launched, they needed a high-impact digital
          presence to support their brand and showcase their expertise. The
          challenge was to translate a minimal set of brand assets—a logo and
          slide deck—into a cohesive and engaging online identity within a short
          timeline. Homework Club addressed this by developing a digital-first
          brand identity, selecting free, high-quality fonts to complement the
          existing logo, and building a custom website that combined
          functionality with striking visuals. Homework Club partnered with them
          to create a custom website that reflected the agency's creative vision
          while offering an intuitive user experience.


          Starting with a simple logo and slide deck, Homework Club developed a
          digital-first brand identity that elevated the visual language of the
          business. The website was designed to be highly visual, featuring
          image and video-led case studies that brought Downtown Productions'
          event experiences to life. Custom Webflow development ensured the site
          was easy to manage, while SEO-optimised landing pages helped maximise
          visibility for their core services.
